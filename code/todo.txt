TODO

1. Fix the shopping list layout to take up less space
2. When adding a recipe to a menu the Servings input should default to the servings defined in the recipe
3. Show text with correct case from lower case
4. Input auto suggests must only load once per page

8. Create javascript input filter

10. When deleting items from a paged screen you should end up on the same screen once deletion is complete

11. Add the Menu data to the shopping list for reference. Maybe insert a reference column in the list so you know
    what recipe an ingredient is for.

12. App.js should broken up into sections that only fire when the appropriate view is on screen. In other words, detect
    what page you are on and fire up page specific variable and handlers. This would be good for things like adding a recipe
    where you could load all the list for ingredient rows, tags once. Then the AJAX handlers would have access to them
    without doing another call. This should speed up the loading of the page.
