1. If you save a recipe without adding any ingredients when you edit the recipe 
you cannot add an ingredient because you cant add an ingredient row.

2. Need to find a new way to display recipe rows. If the recipe list in the Menu collection
    does not start with 0 then the indexing does not work when iterating the recipes
    list. The Recipes are correct, the indexing is wrong.


3. Ingredient row type ahead selection does not seem to happen if the list has 
    two values per line such as "lbs. | pounds"


5. Check that the following adds and edits dont create duplicates
    ingredient
    tags
    unit
