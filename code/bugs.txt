1. If you save a recipe without adding any ingredients when you edit the recipe 
you cannot add an ingredient because you cant add an ingredient row.
2. The check boxes to exclude items from the shopping list appear to be broken
3. Ingredient row type ahead selection does not seem to happen if the list has 
    two values per line such as "lbs. | pounds"
4. When adding a new ingredient, or editing an existing ingredient. If there is a duplicate then handle it
    because we only want one of every ingredient
